      <br>
      <p>The real reason why I took computer science as my course in college was because I thought I could take it on. Plus, it sounded like an interesting course and my mom encouraged me to take it as she took it for a sem or two when she began college too.</p><br>
      <p>My favorite cmsc subject so far is CMSC 22 because we got to program a game, it was fun</p><br>
      <p>My favorite programming language is C. It's the language I understand the most.</p><br>
